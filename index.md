## [](#header-1) esmero in too many words

*esmero* will be a simplistic, semantic, modern (whatever that means), mostly serverless and cloud based **Digital Objects Repository Ecosystem** 
designed and developed with radip deployment and ease of use in mind. 

By incorporating existing Opensource community bestpractices, cloud building blocks, code and open standards, including
listening to peoples daily needs, we have come to the conclusion, a.k.a *-we think*-, we can remove some unneeded complexities
from this type of systems. If we will be able to reach that goal is yet to be seen of course.

## [](#header-1) For whom may *esmero* be?

We think there is a large group of individuals and institutiones that have a set of needs (and hopes) not being
served fully by existing repository systems. To clarify: those other projects are doing nothing wrong, they have chosen a path and
are maintaining a very large and important based of users. They
are just focusing on a different group and need to maintain a evolving constant to avoid breaking what is already there.

A new system can skip some of those constrains.

The fact that *esmero* incorporates a lot of backend knowlegde, good practices and code
from projects like Fedora and Islandora (and we collaborate individually as members of those) is a sign that we search
integration with existing ways of doing things but diverging on how we want to expose our future users (and Developers/IT) to those.

As many repository ecosystems, we search to search serve archivists, metadata professionales, catalogers, small collections, 
Museums, heritage and culture institutions, small, tiny or large or in general those that produce digital representation 
of things and concepts that require: 
 * Standard based classification and description
 * Digital processing
 * Reuse of vocabularies 
 * Safe storage 
 * Preservation *Big word!*
 * Discovery
 * Interoperatibility and Harvest
 * Exhibit and display
 
and humans && institutiones that:
 * Want a simpler system to learn and use 
 * Are Understaffed or can't devote staff to this
 * Like to collaborate with others and share data
 * Care more about the "what" than the "how" (at least the how in *i don't know how*)
 
 ## [](#header-2)What is next?
 
 We are already developing and testing some ideas. Soon we will be sharing code and HOW-TO's openly here.
 Technology piece, languages and standards are mostly decided and our architecture established. We can't say too much, but 
 this is being cooked on swarms of Containers, A LOT of Cloud services, Fedora4/5API and Fedora3 (dual!), PHP 7 and Node.js
 
 Stay tunned and come back from time to time or open [an issue](https://github.com/esmero/esmero-ldp) if you want to discuss 
 something related to OpenSource, Repositories, Serverless
 and/or unfullfilled needs.
